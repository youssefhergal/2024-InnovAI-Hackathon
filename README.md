In today's fast-paced education environment, students often struggle to find efficient ways to revise and consolidate their knowledge. Manually creating study materials such as quizzes or flashcards can be time-consuming and ineffective. Additionally, locating relevant supplemental resources like guided courses is a fragmented process.

### Impact and Proposed Solution
The **AI Study web app** addresses these issues by automating the creation of personalized study aids. Using advanced AI techniques and efficient database management, the app generates topic-specific quizzes, flashcards, q&a and curates educational courses recommendations, saving students valuable time and enhancing their learning experience.

### Project Outcomes and Deliverables

- **Educational Course Recommendations**: AI-curated relevant courses for deeper understanding.
- **Interactive User Interface**: A responsive and intuitive interface for students to access study aids effortlessly.
- **Integration with Next.js, Dizzle ORM, and Ingest**: Ensures scalability, efficiency, and real-time data handling.
